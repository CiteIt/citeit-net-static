Yes, I saw this earlier today and both Eddie and myself are actually quoted in it. It's a great article, but the problem is that our phylogenetic analyses aren't able to answer whether the sequences are unusual at individual residues, except if they are completely off. On a phylogenetic tree the virus looks totally normal and the close clustering with bats suggest that bats serve as the reservoir. The unusual features of the virus make up a really small part of the genome (<0.1%)so one has to look really closely at all the sequences to see that some of the features (potentially) look engineered. We have a good team lined up to look very critically at this, so we should know much more at the end of the weekend. I should mention that after discussions earlier today, Eddie, Bob, Mike, and myself all find the genome inconsistent with expectations from evolutionary theory. But we have to look at this much more closely and there are still further analyses to be done, so those opinions could still change. Best, Kristian On Fri, Jan 31, 2020 at 18:47 Fauci, Anthony (NIH/NIAID) [E) wrote: Jeremy/Kristian: This just came out today.

Scientists are publicly sharing an ever-growing number of full sequences of the virus from patients-53 at last count in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data database. These viral genomes are being intensely studied to try to understand the origin of 2019-nCoV and how it fits on the family tree of related viruses found in bats and other species. They have also given glimpses into what this newly discovered virus physically looks like. how it's changing. and how it might be stopped. "One of the biggest takeaway messages [from the viral sequences] is that there was a single introduction into humans and then human-to-human spread," says Trevor Bedford, a bioinformatics specialist at the University of Washington, Seattle. The role of Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, China, in spreading 2019-nCoV remains murky, though such sequencing, combined with sampling the market's environment for the presence of the virus, is clarifying that it indeed had an important early role in amplifying the outbreak. The viral sequences, most researchers say, also knock down the idea the pathogen came from a virology institute in Wuhan. In all, 2019-nCoV has nearly 29,000 nucleotides bases that hold the genetic instruction book to produce the virus. Although it's one of the many viruses whose genes are in the form of RNA, scientists convert the viral genome into DNA, with bases known in shorthand as A, T, C, and G, to make it easier to study. Many analyses of 2019-nCoV's sequences have already appeared on virological.org. nextstrain.org, preprint servers like bioRxiv, and even in peer reviewed journals. The sharing of the sequences by Chinese researchers allowed public health labs around the world to develop their own diagnostics for the virus, which now has been found in 18 other countries. (Science's news stories on the outbreak can be found here.) When the first 2019-nCoV sequence became available, researchers placed it on a family tree of known corona viruses which are abundant and infect many species-and found that it was most closely related to relatives found in bats. A team led by Shi Zheng-Li, a coronavirus specialist at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, reported on 23 January on bio Rxiv that 2019-nCoV's sequence was 96.2% similar to a bat virus and had 79.5% similarity to the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a disease whose initial outbreak was also in China more than 15 years ago. But the SARS coronavirus has a similarly close relationship to bat viruses, and sequence data make a powerful case that REV0000798 it jumped into people from a coronavirus in civets that differed from human SARS viruses by as few as 10 nucleotides. That's one reason why many scientists suspect there's an "intermediary" host species-or several-between bats and 2019-nCoV. According to Bedford's analysis, the bat coronavirus sequence that Shi Zheng-Li's team highlighted, dubbed RaTG13, differs from 2019-nCoV by nearly 1100 nucleotides. On nextstrain.org, a site he co-founded, Bedford has created coronavirus family trees (example below) that include bat, civet, SARS, and 2019-nCoV sequences. (The trees are interactive-by dragging a computer mouse over them, it's easy to see the differences and similarities between the sequences.) .....,..,. ""'--u Bedford's analyses of RaTG13 and 2019-nCoV suggest that the two viruses shared a common ancestor 25 to 65 years ago, an estimate he arrived at by combining the difference in nucleotides between the viruses with the presumed rates of mutation in other coronaviruses. So it likely took decades for RaTG13-like viruses to mutate into 2019-nCoV. Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), another human disease caused by a coronavirus, similarly has a link to bat viruses. But studies have built a compelling case it jumped to humans from camels. And the phylogenetic tree from Shi's bioRxiv paper (below) makes the camel-MER$ link easy to see. REV0000799 .------TGEV ---MinkCoV ---Ferret CoV ----Bat CoV CDPHE15 .-----Scotophifus ba CoV 512 .__ ___ PEDV ----Bat CoV HKU10 .-----Min/opt ru b t CoV 1 ,,....____ Miniopterus ba CoV HKUB '.----Hum n CoV NL63 .__ ___ Bal NL63-related CoV ._____ Human CoV 229E SADS-CoV Rhinofophus bat CoV H U2 Hu an CoV OC43 ,____ Murine epa itis virus ---Rat CoV HKU24 .__ Human CoV HKU1 oo Human MERS-CoV IMl,-----1 Camel MERS-CoV 100 Plplstreflus bat CoV HKUS ,._ __ Tylonycteris Ba CoV HKU4 .....__ Hedgehog CoV 00 t SARS-CoV 8J01 '1 Civet SARS-CoV SZ3 Ba SARSr-CoV WIV1 Bat SARSr-CoV SHC014 Bat SARSr-CoV LYRa11 Ba SARSr-CoV Rf1 Bat SARSr-CoV ZC45117 Bat SARSr-CoV HKU3-1 -----Bat SARSr-CoV B 48-31 taCoV u /WIV0S/201 CoV u IV02/2019 100 t CoVtwuh n/WIV04/201 B t CoV uh IV0 /2019 taCoV uh n IV07/2019 tCoV TG13 97 ,_______ Bat Hp BetaCoV Zhejiang 2013 -----1----Rousettus bat CoV HKU9 oo Bat CoV GCCDC1 ,_______ ,av Q. The longer a virus circulates in a human populations, the more time it has to develop mutations that differentiate strains in infected people, and given that the 2019-nCoV sequences analyzed to date differ from each other by seven nucleotides at most, this suggests it jumped into humans very recently. But it remains a mystery which animal spread the virus to humans. "There's a very large gray area between viruses detected in bats and the virus now isolated in humans," says Vincent Munster, a virologist at the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who studies coronaviruses in bats, camels, and others species. Strong evidence suggests the marketplace played an early role in spreading 2019-nCoV, but whether it was the origin of the outbreak remains uncertain. Many of the initially confirmed 2019-nCoV cases-27 of the first 41 in one report, 26 of 47 in another-were connected to the Wuhan market, but up to 45%, including the earliest handful, were not. This raises the possibility that the initial jump into people happened elsewhere. According to Xinhua, the state-run news agency, "environmental sampling" of the Wuhan seafood market has found evidence of 2019-nCoV. Of the 585 samples tested, 33 were positive for 2019-nCoV and all were in the huge market's western portion, which is where wildlife were sold. ''The positive tests from the wet market are hugely important," says Edward Holmes, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Sydney who collaborated with the first group to publicly release a 2019-nCoV sequence. "Such a high rate of positive tests would strongly imply that animals in the market played a key role in the emergence of the virus." REV0000800 Yet there have been no preprints or official scientific reports on the sampling, so it's not clear which, if any, animals tested positive. "Until you consistently isolate the virus out of a single species, it's really, really difficult to try and determine what the natural host is," says Kristian Andersen, an evolutionary biologist at Scripps Research. One possible explanation for the confusion about where the virus first entered humans is if there was a batch of recently infected animals sold at different marketplaces. Or an infected animal trader could have transmitted the virus to different people at different markets. Or, Bedford suggests, those early cases could have been infected by viruses that didn't easily transmit and sputtered out. "It would be hugely helpful to have just a sequence or two from the marketplace [environmental sampling] that could illuminate how many zoonoses occurred and when they occurred," Bedford says. A research group sent fecal and other bodily samples from bats they trapped in caves to the Wuhan Institute of Virology to search for coronaviruses. Eco Health Alliance In the absence of clear conclusions about the outbreak's origin, theories thrive, and some have been scientifically shaky. A sequence analysis led by Wei Ji of Peking University and published online by the Journal of Medical Virology received substantial press coverage when it suggested that "snake is the most probable wildlife animal reservoir for the 2019-nCoV." Sequence specialists, however, pilloried it. Conspiracy theories also abound. A CBC News report about the Canadian government deporting Chinese scientists who worked in a Winnipeg lab that studies dangerous pathogens was distorted on social media to suggest that they were spies who had smuggled out coronaviruses. The Wuhan Institute of Virology, which is the premier lab in China that studies bat and human coronaviruses, has also come under fire. "Experts debunk fringe theory linking China's coronavirus to weapons research," read a headline on a story in The Washington Post that focused on the facility. Concerns about the institute predate this outbreak. Nature ran a story in 2017 about it building a new biosafety level 4 lab and included molecular biologist Richard Ebright of Rutgers University, Piscataway, expressing concerns about accidental infections, which he noted repeatedly happened with lab workers handling SARS in Beijing. Ebright, who has a long history of raising red flags about studies with dangerous pathogens, also in 2015 criticized an experiment in which modifications were made to a SARS-like virus circulating in Chinese bats to see whether it had the potential to cause disease in humans. Earlier this week, Ebright questioned the accuracy of Bedford's calculation that there are at least 25 years of evolutionary distance between RaTG13-the virus held in the Wuhan virology institute-and 2019nCoV, arguing that the mutation rate may have been different as it passed through different hosts before humans. Ebright tells Science Insider that the 2019-nCoV data are "consistent with entry into the human population as a natural accident." Shi did not reply to emails from Science, but her longtime collaborator, disease ecologist Peter Daszak of the EcoHealth Alliance, dismissed Ebright's conjecture. "Every time there's an emerging disease, a new virus, the same story comes out: This is a spillover or the release of an agent or a bioengineered virus," Daszak says. "It's just a shame. It seems humans can't resist controversy and these myths, yet it's staring us right in the face. There's this incredible diversity of REV0000801 viruses in wildlife and we've just scratched the surface. Within that diversity, there will be some that can infect people and within that group will be some that cause illness." A team of researchers from the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the Eco Health Alliance have trapped bats in caves all over China, like this one in Guangdong, to sample them for coronaviruses. EcoHealth Alliance Daszak and Shi's group have for 8 years been trapping bats in caves around China to sample their feces and blood for viruses. He says they have sampled more than 10,000 bats and 2000 other species. They have found some 500 novel coronaviruses, about SO of which fall relatively close to the SARS virus on the family tree, including RaTG13-it was fished out of a bat fecal sample they collected in 2013 from a cave in Moglang in Yunnan province. "We cannot assume that just because this virus from Yunnan has high sequence identity with the new one that that's the origin," Daszak says, noting that only a tiny fraction of coronaviruses that infect bats have been discovered. "I expect that once we've sampled and sampled and sampled across southern China and central China that we're going to find many other viruses and some of them will be closer [to 2019-nCoV]." It's not just a "curious interest" to figure out what sparked the current outbreak, Daszak says. "If we don't find the origin, it could still be a raging infection at a farm somewhere, and once this outbreak dies, there could be a continued spillover that's really hard to stop. But the jury is still out on what the real origins of this are." Posted in: • Asia/Pacific • Health • Coronavirus doi:10.1126/science.abb1256 Jon Cohen Jon is a staff writer for Science. • Email Jon • Twitter REV0000802 Disclaimer: Any third-party material in this email has been shared for internal use under fair use provisions of U.S. copyright law, without further verification of its accuracy/veracity.

[ask ex.perts to add specifics re binding sites?] They also told us that additional genomic sequence data from geographically and temporally diverse viral samples, including samples that have been collected prior to the outbreak in Wuhan, could be used to clarify the origins of the virus. Understanding the driving forces behind vira[ evolution may facilitate the development of more effective strategies for managing the 2019-nCo V outbreak international collaboration is more important than ever to overcome these types of global challenges. The National Academies stand ready to assemble a committee of experts to examine these issues in more detail and provide more complete evidence-based advice to you in an expedited manner if requested. Thank you, again for your commitment to the National Academies a11d our efforts to provjde independent, objective analysis; advise the nation; and inform public policy decisions. Sincerely, 1"20 J9 Novd Coronaviros (2019-nCoV) Situation Sumirmry.~Centers forDiscasa Control 1md Prevemion. 3 Feb. 2020.

And as Eddie mentioned this is becoming more likely from day to day with the pangolin story. I disagree with Ron that the passaging hypothesis is evidentially equal to the engineering hypothesis. The sequence data clearly and unambiguously rules out any form oflab construct or engineering of the virus. It doesn't really have anything to say about the relative plausibility of the 3 hypotheses for selection. I think we need stronger arguments than an assertion that no lab has done those experiments. We can definitely argue that it has nothing to do with RaTG 13 ( or SARS or any other published SARSr virus). The argument that we would need to offer this hypothesis for all other outbreaks is not a useful one in this context. Is it possible to argue that A) a passaging experiment wouldn't create the features we see? or B) that there are logical reasons why someone wouldn't do such an experiment? The pangolin virus that was announced in the press conference might solve this issue if it has the furin cleavage site insertion which would be all but conclusive for the natural scenario. Andrew rfgarry1 r.fouchier REV0000735 On 8 Feb 2020, at 20:21, Jeremy Farrar wrote: The theory of the origin of the has gathered considerable momentum not in social media, but increasingly among some scientists, in main stream media, and among politicians. The aim of this was to bring a neutral, respected, scientific group together to look at the data and in a neutral, considered way provide an opinion and we hoped to focus the discussion on the science, not on any conspiracy or other theory and to lay down a respected statement to frame whatever debate goes on -before that debate gets out of hand with potentially hugely damaging ramifications. With the additional information on the pangolin virus, information not available even 24 hours ago, I think the argument is even clearer. My preference is that a carefully considered piece of science, early in the public domain, will help mitigate more polarised debate.

I fail to see how the last of the three discussed scenarios (passaging) does not fall under the category of "laboratory manipulation". There is no evidence that might hint to this scenario and hence it should be put aside just like the engineering option. As far as I am aware, no laboratory has worked on passaging the pangolin-origin virus, the bat-CoV RaTG13, or another closely related virus or had access to it prior to the outbreak. That nCoV-2019 could originate from a SARS-like virus in Chinese labs can also be excluded. This information could be added after reference 10 in the manuscript, to provide further argument. If we assume passaging as a possible scenario here, we must assume it is also plausible for all outbreaks from the past, present and future. This manuscript would be much stronger if it focused on the likelihood of the first 2 scenarios as compared to intentional or accidental release. That would also limit the chance of new biosafety discussions that would unnecessarily obstruct future attempts of virus culturing for research and diagnostic purposes for any (emerging/zoonotic) virus. I made some additional comments in the attached pdf, also in line with Andrew's comments. With kind regards, Ron Van: Jeremy Farrar Datum: zaterdag 8 februari 2020 om 10:45 Andrew Rambaut • Onderwerp: FW: 2019 N-CoV APOLOGIES WITH ALL CORRECT EMAILS Kristen, Andrew, Bob, Eddie have reworked the summary and it is attached here. We are pushing to get the sequence data from the reports on the pangolins, but do not have currently, very important to incorporate. Interested in your views Is this reasonably balanced given the data? clearly that is REV0000343 Is there anything anyone disagrees with? Is there anything more in relation to what would seem to be the two possibilities o Nature, Intermediate host, evolution and passage Future data you may have Advice on whether KA, AR, RG and EH should publish this. These and other thoughts welcome in confidence. REV0000344 Message From: Sent: To: CC: Subject: kga19781-collinsf-afauci~-Josie Golding christian.drosten-Attachments: Summary.Feb7_MF.pdf Dear Jeremy et al I have made some comments and suggestions on the pdf attached. I am not an expert on protein O-glycosylation -however, Dr Tabak, who was on the call last weekend, is and if I were to consult anyone else on this it would be Henrik Clausen https://icmm.ku.dk/english/research-groups/clausen-group/ However, from what I do know of general glycobiology, I am not sure one can conclude that an immune system would be required to select for O-glycosylation sites.

We investigate these features and outline some examples for how the virus may have acquired them. We also discuss some scenarios by which these features could hm,e arisen. Analysis of the virus genome sequences clearly demonstrates that the virus is not a laboratory construct or experimentally manipulated virus. We believe the features discussed, which may explain the infectiousness and transmissibility of 2019-nCoV in humans, €61:::Hehave~risen through selection and adaptation prior to the initial outbreak. The two primary features of 2019-nCoV of interest were: • Based on structural modeling and early biochemical experiments, 2019-nCoV appears to be optimized for binding to the human ACE2 receptor. • The highly variable spike protein of 2019-nCoV has a furin cleavage inserted at the S1 and S2 boundary via the insertion of twelve in-frame nucleotides. Additionally, this event also led to the acquisition of three predicted O linlEed glycan§.__around the furin cleavage site. Mutations in the receptor binding domain of 2019-nCoV The receptor binding domain (RBD) in the spike protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-like coronaviruses is the most variable part of the virus genome. When aligned against related viruses, 2019-nCoV displays a similar level of diversity as predicted from previous studies, including to its most closely relate~virus SARS-like CoV isolated from bats (RaTG13, which is ~96% identical to 2019-nCoV). Six residues in the RBD have been described as critical for binding to the human ACE2 receptor and determining host range1. Using coordinates based on the Ubani strain of SARS-CoV,they are Y442, L472, N479, D480, T487, and Y491 (the corresponding residues in 2019-nCoV are L455, F486, Q493, S494, N501, and YSOS). Five out of six of these residues are mutated in 2019-nCoV compared to the closely related virus, RaTG13(Figure 1). Based on modeling 1 and early biochemical experiments 2.3, 2019-nCoV seems to have an RBD that may bind with high affinity to ACE2 from human, primate, ferret, pig, and cat, as well as other species with high receptor homology. In contrast, 2019-nCoV may bind less efficiently to ACE2 in other species associated with SARS-like viruses, including r.~1.1.J.J..1..2....i...u· 1....__ ___u...i..~LL.l.!,,jL....l,,,il~ _________ do we have the pangolin ACE2 sequence/model?A phenylalanine at F486 in 2019-nCoV corresponds to L4 experiments the leucine at position 472 mutated to phenylalanine (L472F)4, which has been predicted to be optimal for binding of the SARS-CoV RBD to the human ACE2 receptor 5• However, a phenylalanine in this position is also present in several SARS-like CoVs from bats (Figure 1). While these analyses suggest that 2019-nCoV may be capable of binding the human ACE2 receptor with high affinity, importantly, the interaction is not predicted to be optimal1. Additionally, several of the key residues in the RBD of 2019-nCoV are different from those previously described to be optimal for human ACE2 receptor binding as determined by both natural evolution of SARS-CoV and rational designs. This latter point is strong evidence against 2019-nCoV being specifically engineered as, presumably, in such a scenario the most optimal residues would have been introduced, which is not what we observe. 1.SAAScoron~NSC01S·MV91998.1 ~WNTRNIOATSTGN~NYKYR~LRHGKLRPFEROISNVPFSPOGKPCT PPAPNCYWPLRllYGFYTTSGIGYQPVRVVVLSFELLNAPAT' 2.

Key residues in the spike protein that make contact to the REV0000829 ACE2 receptor have been marked with blue boxes in both 2019-nCoV and the SARS-CoV Urbani strain. Furin cleavage site and o linked glycan~ An interesting feature of 2019-nCoV is a predicted furin cleavage site in the spike protein (Figure 2). In addition to the furin cleavage site (RRAR), a leading P is also inserted so the fully inserted sequence becomes PRRA (Figure 2). A proline in this position is predicted to create three flanking O liRl<ed glycan~ at S673, T678, and S686. A furin site has never before been observed in the lineage B betacoronaviruses and is a unique feature of 2019-nCoV. Some human betacoronaviruses, including HCoV-HKU1 (lineage A) have furin cleavage sites (typically RRKR), although not in such an optimal position. 1.SARscc,onMNSC018·AA\/9799S.1 I Y S TGlllNVF QTOAGC LI GAE HIio.TS YE co IP I GAG I CAS YHT■ S S l R STS OKS I VA YTMSL GAGSS I A Y SNNT I A I PTN F S I 2.SARSccron.MnaA0:21 AAW7Q&i.1 J YSTG1'1NVJ!QTQAGCL IGAEHVIJTSVECO P j GA.GI CASYHTIIISS-1 RSTSQKS I VAVTMSlGA.VSS IAVSNNT I At P'TNI= SI 3.SARSccro"J\'f,usAOOl,AA\19798◄.I I Y 5 TGN!lillf QTOAGC l 1 GAE HIIQTS YE CO P I GAG 1 CA 5 Y HT S SI RS TS QK 5 VAYTMSL GAQ'.S S 1 A Y SNNT I A I P°IN f S I ~.S/IRScoron.wirvs8Jl82·12 •AC-OS.1 1 Y 5 TGNNVF QTQAGC L I GAE HVO:T SY ECO P I GAG I CA S YHTIIS■ l RS TS OKS VAYTMSL GAllS SI AY SNNT I A I P°IN F S I 5.SARScoronJVirus8j182.l·ACB69™>.1 I Y S TGNNV F QTQAGC L 1 GAE HVQ I'S YE co P I GAG I CAS YH T■S■ l RS TS QK S VA YTMSL GAO:SS 1 A Y SNNT I A IP 1N F S I 6.SARSccronMttJSfrantfun 1-AAP33697.1 I YS TGNNV f QTOAGC L 1 GAE HVD'TS Y ECO P I GAG I CA 5 YHl S■ I RS r 5 OK 5 VAYTMSL GMlSS 1 AV SNNT I A I PTN f 5 I 7.SARSroron.wiru'IVrboni..1'Y278?41.1 •Spr..

The furin cleavage site is marked in grey with the three adjacent 1=1rediceedo liAIEeel glycan§lln blue. Both the furin cleavage site and o linlEeEl glycaA~are unique to 2019-nCoV and not previously seen in this group of viruses. While the functional consequence -if any -of the furin cleavage site in 2019-nCoV is unknown, previous experiments with SARS-CoV have shown that it enhances cell-cell fusion but does not affect virus entry6• Furin cleavage sites are often acquired in conditio!l._selecting for rapid virus replication and transmission (e.g., highly dense chicken populations) and are a hallmark of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, although these viruses acquire the site in different and more direct ways7-9 • The acquisition of furin cleavage sites have also been observed after repeated passage of viruses in cell culture (personal correspondence and NASEM call, February 3, 2020). A potential function of the three predicted O-linked glycans is less clear, but could create a "mucin-like domain" shielding potential epitopes or key residues on the 2019-nCoV spike protein. Origin of 2019-nCoV As noted at the start of this document, we believe that the origin of 2019-nCoV through laboratory manipulation of an existing SARS-related coronavirus can be ruled out with a high degree of confidence. If genetic manipulation would have been performed, one would expect that a researcher would ha1o1e ttSee one of the several reverse genetics systems available for betacoronaviruse~ However, this is not the case as the genetic data clearly shows that 2019-nCoV is not derived from any previously used virus backbone, for example those described in a 2015 paper in Nature Medicine10. Instead we believe one of three main scenarios could explain how 2019-nCoV acquired the features discussed above: (1) natural selection In humans, (2) natural selection In an animal host, or (3) selection during passage. Adaptation to humans As the features outlined above are likely to enhance the ability of the virus to infect humans, it is possible that these are indeed adaptations to humans as a host and arose after the virus jumped from a non-human host, during the early stages of the epidemic. However, all of the genome sequences so far have the features described above and estimates of the timing of the most recent common ancestor of the currently sampled viruses support the seafood market outbreak as the zoonotic origin (i.e., in early December) and this would afford little opportunity for adaptation to occur. This may be explained by a transition to a rapid growth phase in the epidemic when the features arose and from which all current REV0000830 cases are derived. However this would require a prior hidden epidemic of sufficient magnitude and duration for the adaptations to occur and there is no evidence of this. We also note that these features did not emerge during the SARS epidemic, which involved extensive human to human transmission. Selection in an animal host Given the similarity of 2019-nCoV to bat SARS-like CoVs, particularly RaTG13, it is highly likely that bats serve as the reservoir for this virus. However, previous human epidemics caused by betacoronaviruses have involved intermediate (possibly amplifying) hosts such as civets and other animals (SARS) and camels (MERS). It is therefore likely that an intermediate host would also exist for 2019-nCoV, although it is unclear what that host may be. Given the mutations in key residues of the RBD in 2019-nCoV it seems less likely that civets would be involved, although it is impossible to say with certainty at this stage. Notably, provisional analyses reveal that Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) illegally imported into Guangdong province contain Co Vs that are extremely similar to 2019-nCoV11. Although RaTG13 remains the closest relative to 2019-nCoV across the genome as a whole, the Malayan pangolin CoVs are identical to 2019-nCoV at all six key RBD residues. Analyses of these pangolin viruses are ongoing, although they do not carry the furin cleavage site insertion. For the virus to acquire the furin cleavage site and mutations in the spike proteins that appear to be suitable for human ACE2 receptor binding, it seems plausible that this animal host would have to have a high population density -to allow the necessary natural selection to proceed efficiently -and an ACE2 gene that is similar to the human orthologue. Since furin cleavage sites have not been observed in sarbecoviruses before, it is unclear what conditions would be required for it to be acquired in the lineage leading to 2019-nCoV. Selection durin assa e Ba glycosylation (0-and N-) can reduce host immune response to antigens -but is there any be evidence that neutralising antibodies are made to this region of spike protein? If not, where 20 would the selective pressure come from? O-glycosylation (if present) could just as easily be cul stabilising (or preventing) a secondary structure feature (i.e., not immune system driven). Also the note that O-glycosylation predictors tend to over-predict, experimental evidence (mass spec) of important. Also, one of the most common functions of glycosylation is to protect the underlying bel peptide from proteolysis -i.e., these sites if occupied might actually reduce the efficiency of the ro furtin cleavag site. ct Limitations and recommendations The evolution scenarios discussed above are largely indistinguishable and current data are consistent with all three. It is currently impossible to prove or disprove either, and it is unclear whether future data or analyses will help resolve this issue. Identifying the immediate non-human animal source and obtaining virus sequences from it would be the most definitive way of distinguishing the three scenarios. The main limitation of what is described here is our clear ascertainment bias. We are looking for features or evolutionary aspects that could help explain how 2019-nCoV lead to such a rapidly expanding human epidemic, yet the specific features we are trying to find may be the exact features one would expect in a virus that could lead to an epidemic of the magnitude currently observed. Before 2019-nCoV 'took off and started the current epidemic, it is plausible that many stuttering transmission chains of highly similar viruses could have entered the human population, but because they never took off they were never sampled. It is extremely important to keep this in mind as any inference about the plausibility of various scenarios about the evolution and/or epidemic potential of 2019-nCoV is attempted. To further clarify the evolutionary origins and functional features of 2019-nCoV it would be helpful to obtain additional data about the virus -both genetic and functional. This includes experimental studies of receptor binding and the role of the furin cleavage site and predicted 0-linked glycans. The identification of a potential intermediate host of 2019-nCoV as well as sequencing of very early cases, including those not connected to the market, could also help refute the passage scenario described above. Even in the REV0000831 light of such data, however, it is not guaranteed that data can be obtained to conclusively prove all aspects of the initial emergence of 2019-nCoV. REV0000832 References 1.

Yes, there is speculation in the public domain, triggered by several papers, including the rubbish ones. By zooming in on a specific finding that is NOT in the public domain as far as I know, I think this will generate its own conspiracy theories. So if published, I would suggest zooming out a bit for starters, describing that one of the key challenges is where this virus came from, discuss some of the (wild) guesses out there, and then argue step by step what the challenges are in inferring this from sequence data, where you do not know exactly what the pool is that you are sampling from, so end up interpreting the needle drawn out of a haystack. Here, the many pieces of the discussion that passed by these last few days can be included, like rates of evolution and dating of possible origins; examples of cleavage site acquisition from other viruses, recombination in coronavirus evolutionary history, possible abrupt changes in spillover events, ability to confirm or disproof things in vitro. etc And I would leave "lab escape"for the discussion, because putting that in the public domain as a hypothesis in my view will be read as "see, they also thought so" Marion REV0000812 wrote: wrote: On 8 Feb 2020, at 22:15, Kristian G. Andersen• wrote: A lot of good discussion here, so I just wanted to add a couple of things for context that I think are important -and why what we're considering is far from "another conspiracy theory", but rather is taking a valid scientific approach to a question that is increasingly being asked by the public, media, scientists, and politicians (e.g., I have been contacted by Science, NYT, and many other news outlets over the last couple of days about this exact question). To Ron's question, passage of SARS-like Co Vs have been ongoing for several years, and more specifically in Wuhan under BSL-2 conditions -see references 12-15 in the document for a few examples. The fact that Wuhan became the epicenter of the ongoing epidemic caused by nCoV is likely an unfortunate coincidence, but it raises questions that would be wrong to dismiss out of hand. Our main work over the last couple of weeks has been focused on trying to disprove any type of lab theory, but we are at a crossroad where the scientific evidence isn't conclusive enough to say that we have high confidence in any of the three main theories considered. Like Eddie -and I believe Bob, Andrew, and everybody on this email as well -I am very hopeful that the viruses from pangolins will help provide the missing pieces. For now, giving the lab theory serious consideration has been highly effective at countering many of the circulating conspiracy theories, including HIV recombinants, bioengineering, etc. -here's just one example: https://www.factcheck.org/2020/02/baseless-conspiracy-theories-claim-new-coronavirus-wasbioengineered/. As to publishing this document in a journal, I am currently not in favor of doing so. I believe that publishing something that is open-ended could backfire at this stage. I think it's important that we try to gather additional evidence -including waiting on the pangolin virus sequences and further scrutinize the furin cleavage site and O-linked glycans -before publishing. That way we can (hopefully) come out with some strong conclusive statements that are based on the best data we have access to.

I'll discuss with the other authors to see what the best path would be -just one thing to make clear though, reviewer 2 is unfortunately wrong about "Once the authors publish their new pangolin sequences, a lab origin will be extremely unlikely". Had that been the case, we would of course have included that -but the more sequences we see from pangolins ( and we have been analyzing/discussing these very carefully) the more unlikely it seems that they're intermediate hosts. They definitely harbor SARS-Co V-like viruses, no doubt, but it's unlikely they have a direct connection to the COVID-19 epidemic. Unfortunately none of this helps refute a lab origin and the possibility must be considered as a serious scientific theory (which is what we do) and not dismissed out of hand as another 'conspiracy' theory.

We've now obtained two ref reports on the paper (appended below) and I've had the opportunity to discuss them with our chief editor Magdalena Skipper. In the light of the advice received I am afraid we have decided that we cannot offer to publish the Perspective in Nature. REV0002621 While the Perspective is interesting and timely one of our referees raised concerns (also emphasised to the editors) about whether such a piece would feed or quash the conspiracy theories.

If you would like to pursue this option, please transfer the submission to Nature Medicine using the link provided below. Feel free to reach out to Joao Monteiro, chief editor, at joao .. monteiro@us.nature.com if you want to discuss the transfer process or have questions. Nature Ecology & Evolution would be interested in considering the manuscript as a Comment article.

If this option is of interest, you can also use the link below to transfer, and please feel free to get in touch with Patrick Goymer (p.goymer@nature.com) to discuss it further. Finally, Nature Microbiology would similarly be interested in considering a revised manuscript that addresses the main concerns from the referees as a Comment article. Should you be interested in this option, please use the link below to transfer and please feel free to contact Nonia Pariente (nonia.pariente@nature.com; who is currently out of the office but will be back on Feb 24th) and Paula Jauregui (paula.jauregui@nature.com) to discuss further. I am sorry that we cannot be more positive on this occasion.

We hope that you will find our referees' comments helpful. With best wishes, Clare Clare Thomas Senior Editor Nature Referees' comments: Referee #1 (Remarks to the Author): Anderson presented a timely manuscript to share their points of view about the origin of SARS-CoV-2. There are several rumors about the origin of this virus. However, these "hypotheses" are entirely based on very limited, if any, scientific evidences. This reviewer sees most of the arguments raised by the authors are valid and convincing. However, the authors might want to consider these minor suggestions: 1.The sections for the RBD and cleavage site of Spike protein basically have summarized the existing findings from other recent publications. The authors might want to spell out that these two sections are REV0002622 review summaries. In addition, the author can present these two sections in a more condense format and save some space for something else (also see points 6 and 7 below) 2. Fig. 1. This figure has 6 aligned sequences, but with only 5 sequence titles. The order of these titles are also not correct. 3. Lines 170 -174. It is correct that no adaptive mutation has been found in the spike ofMERS-CoV. Deletions in other ORF regions, however, were detected in some human MERS-Co V viruses (PMID: 26981770). In addition, the 29nt deletion of human SARS-CoV (PMID: 12958366) was suggested to have effects on host adaptation. The authors should also consider these findings. It is premature to say that this would not happen in SARS-CoV-2. 4.Line 194. The accident at Singapore occurred in a BSL3, not BSL2, containment. 5. Line 194. Laboratory escapes of SARS occurred in Singapore, China and Taiwan (PMID: 16830004). 6.There are two recent reports about coronaviruses in pangolins (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10. l 101/2020.02.13.945485vl .full.pdf; https://www.biorxiv.org/content/l0.l 101/2020.02.08.939660v2.ful1.pdf). The authors might want to comments on these. 7. Optional: Can the authors share their views on the possibility of having a lab escape of a natural coronavirus? This is also one of the hypotheses that have been extensively discussed. The reviewer understand that this is entirely a different topic, but any insights are welcomed. Referee #2 (Remarks to the Author): This is a perspective discussing evidence against a hypothetical lab origin of SARS-Co V-2. The paper addresses suboptimal composition of ACE2-binding sites in the RBD, 3 predicted O-linked glycosylation sites and a furin cleavage site in the glycoprotein that was speculated upon before. The paper is itself interesting, but unnecessarily speculative. It's not clear why the authors do not refute a hypothetical lab origin in their coming publication on the ancestors of SARS-Co V-2 in bats and pangolins. The tree showing diverse pangolin viruses has kindly been made available by some of the authors in GISAID. Once the authors publish their new pangolin sequences, a lab origin will be extremely unlikely. It is not clear why the authors rush with a speculative perspective if their central hypothesis can be supported by their own data. Please explain. Another critical aspect of this text is the complete lack of referencing to a potential debate on a hypothetical lab origin. Who said this, why is this considered a problem? There are indeed a few apparently uninformed statements claiming the virus may be a Chinese bioweapon, but is this really problematic on a larger scale? The central reason for issuing this text must be exhaustively referenced and discussed. The authors state that a predicted polybasic cleavage sites is unique to SARS-CoV-2 in SARS viruses. Who knows how many out of thousands undiscovered bat ancestors also acquired such a motif, the sampling bias in descriptions of remote bat viruses is dramatic. This should be discussed. Also state clearly that this site is only predicted so far and that experimental evidence for its biological function and its potential impact on pathogenesis are required. The predicted O-linked glycosylation sites are mysterious. What do the authors imply with those sites? In REV0002623 silico prediction of O-linked glycosylation sites is not robust and whether these sites indeed exist requires experimental validation. Even if those sites exist, why are they relevant? This is not addressed at all. If the authors assume these sites constitute part of a glycan shield, they should say so and weigh their assumption carefully. Finally, the main argument against a hypothetical lab origin seems the required reconstruction of a backbone of a bat virus of unknown pathogenesis. It does not seem feasible that any scientist would disembark on such an uncertain endeavor. This difficulties of coronavirus reverse genetics should be stated clearly. **If you wish to transfer your manuscript to Nature Medicine, you may use our manuscript transfer portal to initiate the transfer to this journal ( or to another journal of your choice in the Nature Research portfolio).

I'll discuss with the other authors to see what the best path would be -just one thing to make clear though, reviewer 2 is unfortunately wrong about "Once the authors publish their new pangolin sequences, a lab origin will be extremely unlikely". Had that been the case, we would of course have included that -but the more sequences we see from pangolins (and we have been analyzing/discussing these very carefully) the more unlikely it seems that they're intermediate hosts. They definitely harbor SARS-CoV-like viruses, no doubt, but it's unlikely they have a direct connection to the COVID-19 epidemic. Unfortunately none of this helps refute a lab origin and the possibility must be considered as a serious scientific theory (which is what we do) and not dismissed out of hand as another 'conspiracy' theory. We all really, really wish that we could do that (that's how this got started), but unfortunately it's just not possible given the data. Thanks again for considering our manuscript and while we had of course hoped for a better outcome, we understand the decision. Best, Kristian On Thu, Feb 20, 2020 at 8:52 AM· wrote: 20th February 2020 Dear Kristian, Thank you for submitting your manuscript entitled "The Proximal Origin of SARS-CoV-2" to be considered for publication in Nature. We've now obtained two refreports on the paper (appended below) and I've had the opportunity to discuss them with our chief editor Magdalena Skipper. In the light of the advice received I am afraid we have decided that we REV0000261 the link the link cannot offer to publish the Perspective in Nature. While the Perspective is interesting and timely one of our referees raised concerns (also emphasised to the editors) about whether such a piece would feed or quash the conspiracy theories. But more importantly this reviewer feels, and we agree, that the Perspective would quickly become outdated when more scientific data are published (for example on potential reservoir hosts). I did, however, take the liberty of consulting with my colleagues at Nature Medicine, Nature Ecology and Evolution and Nature Microbiology and I am happy to say that all three journals were interested in publishing a revised piece in some form. Nature Medicine are interested in publishing it either as a Comment or a Correspondence. If you would like to pursue this option, please transfer the submission to Nature Medicine rovided below. Feel free to reach out to Joao Monteiro, chief editor, at if you want to discuss the transfer process or have questions. Nature Ecology & Evolution would be interested in considering the manuscript as a Comment article. They would like to work with you to address the reviewers' concerns and restructure the manuscript to focus more on the plausible evolutionary scenarios. If this option is of interest, you can also use the link below to transfer, and please feel free to get in touch with Patrick Goymer o discuss it further. Finally, Nature Microbiology would similarly be interested in considering a revised manuscript that addresses the main concerns from the referees as a Comment article. Should you be interested in this o tion lease use the link below to transfer and please feel free to contact Nonia Pariente ( who is currently out of the office but will be back on Feb 24th) and Paula Jauregui to discuss further. I am sorry that we cannot be more positive on this occasion. We hope that our decision does not discourage you from submitting your work to us in future as we remain interested in publishing key developments in this area of research. We hope that you will find our referees' comments helpful. With best wishes, Clare Clare Thomas Senior Editor Nature Referees' comments: Referee #1 (Remarks to the Author): Anderson presented a timely manuscript to share their points of view about the origin of SARS-CoV-2. There are several rumors about the origin of this virus. However, these "hypotheses" are entirely based on very limited, if any, scientific evidences. This reviewer sees most of the arguments raised by the authors are valid and convincing. REV0000262 However, the authors might want to consider these minor suggestions: 1.The sections for the RBD and cleavage site of Spike protein basically have summarized the existing findings from other recent publications. The authors might want to spell out that these two sections are review summaries. In addition, the author can present these two sections in a more condense format and save some space for something else ( also see points 6 and 7 below) 2. Fig. 1. This figure has 6 aligned sequences, but with only 5 sequence titles. The order of these titles are also not correct. 3. Lines 170 -174. It is correct that no adaptive mutation has been found in the spike of MERS-Co V. Deletions in other ORF regions, however, were detected in some human MERS-CoV viruses (PMID: 26981770). In addition, the 29nt deletion of human SARS-CoV (PMID: 12958366) was suggested to have effects on host adaptation. The authors should also consider these findings. It is premature to say that this would not happen in SARS-CoV-2. 4.Line 194. The accident at Singapore occurred in a BSL3, not BSL2, containment. 5. Line 194. Laboratory escapes of SARS occurred in Singapore, China and Taiwan (PMID: 16830004). 6.There are two recent reports about coronaviruses in pangolins (https:/ /www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.13.945485vl .full.pdf; https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.08.939660v2.full.pdf). The authors might want to comments on these. 7. Optional: Can the authors share their views on the possibility of having a lab escape of a natural coronavirus? This is also one of the hypotheses that have been extensively discussed. The reviewer understand that this is entirely a different topic, but any insights are welcomed. Referee #2 (Remarks to the Author): This is a perspective discussing evidence against a hypothetical lab origin of SARS-Co V-2. The paper addresses suboptimal composition of ACE2-binding sites in the RBD, 3 predicted O-linked glycosylation sites and a furin cleavage site in the glycoprotein that was speculated upon before. The paper is itself interesting, but unnecessarily speculative. It's not clear why the authors do not refute a hypothetical lab origin in their coming publication on the ancestors of SARS-Co V-2 in bats and pangolins. The tree showing diverse pangolin viruses has kindly been made available by some of the authors in GISAID. Once the authors publish their new pangolin sequences, a lab origin will be extremely unlikely. It is not clear why the authors rush with a speculative perspective if their central hypothesis can be supported by their own data. Please explain. Another critical aspect of this text is the complete lack of referencing to a potential debate on a hypothetical lab origin. Who said this, why is this considered a problem? There are indeed a few apparently uninformed statements claiming the virus may be a Chinese bioweapon, but is this really problematic on a larger scale? The central reason for issuing this text must be REV0000263 exhaustively referenced and discussed. The authors state that a predicted polybasic cleavage sites is unique to SARS-Co V-2 in SARS viruses. Who knows how many out of thousands undiscovered bat ancestors also acquired such a motif, the sampling bias in descriptions of remote bat viruses is dramatic. This should be discussed. Also state clearly that this site is only predicted so far and that experimental evidence for its biological function and its potential impact on pathogenesis are required. The predicted O-linked glycosylation sites are mysterious. What do the authors imply with those sites? In silico prediction of O-linked glycosylation sites is not robust and whether these sites indeed exist requires experimental validation. Even if those sites exist, why are they relevant? This is not addressed at all. If the authors assume these sites constitute part of a glycan shield, they should say so and weigh their assumption carefully. Finally, the main argument against a hypothetical lab origin seems the required reconstruction of a backbone of a bat virus of unknown pathogenesis. It does not seem feasible that any scientist would disembark on such an uncertain endeavor. This difficulties of coronavirus reverse genetics should be stated clearly. **If you wish to transfer your manuscript to Nature Medicine, you may use our manuscript transfer portal to initiate the transfer to this journal ( or to another journal of your choice in the Nature Research portfolio).

The WHO -while they now acknowledge SARS-CoV-2 as the official name of the virus, they refuse to use it because of stigma and other issues.

The fact that Wuhan became the epicenter of the ongoing epidemic caused by nCoV is likely an unfortunate coincidence, but it raises questions that would be wrong to dismiss out of hand. Our main work over the last couple of weeks has been focused on trying to disprove any type of lab theory, but we are at a crossroad where the scientific evidence isn't conclusive enough to say that we have high confidence in any of the three main theories considered. Like Eddie -and I believe Bob, Andrew, and everybody on this email as well -I am very hopeful that the viruses from pangolins will help provide the missing pieces. For now, giving the lab theory serious consideration has been highly effective at countering many of the circulating conspiracy theories, including HIV recombinants, bioengineering, etc. -here's just one example: https://www.factcheck.org/2020/02/baseless-conspiracy-theories-claim-new-coronavirus-wasbioengineered/. As to publishing this document in a journal, I am currently not in favor of doing so. I believe that publishing something that is open-ended could backfire at this stage. I think it's important that we try to gather additional evidence -including waiting on the pangolin virus sequences and further scrutinize the furin cleavage site and O-linked glycans -before REV0000722 publishing.

Also happens to be true. He's also agreed to be cc' d on the reply to Jon which is great because he will be able to confirm. So, I've edited the draft email to Jon accordingly (Kristian, I've moved some sentences around). Jeremy's comms person at Wellome also had some suggestions and I'll forward that in a sec. Cheers, Eddie Hi Jon, Here are the facts: 1. On Jan 27 Jeremy Farrar called one of us (Eddie) to say that some rumours were coming out of the US that the virus may be a lab escape and could he determine whether this had any scientific credibility. By coincidence, on Jan 31 Kristian independently contacted Eddie to note that there was some features in the SARS-CoV-2 genome that at the time appeared unusual, particularly the furin cleavage site and the receptor binding domain. 2. At this stage we thought it was wise to ask for additional opinion on this, so a conference call was rapidly arranged for Feb 1 (Feb 2 Eddie's time). There were indeed other coronavirus experts on the call, chosen by Jeremy and Eddie. It is worth pointing out at this point that the senior author on our paper -Bob Garry -has published a significant number of papers on coronaviruses, including on the SARS spike protein, and even commented on this on the virological.org website prior to the call taking place (https://virological.org/Uanalysis-of-wuhan-coronavirus-deja-vu/357). 3. Clearly, some people on the call were very strongly of the opinion that the possibility of a lab escape was implausible and gave reasons why it should be dismissed (although there was also some initial confusion about whether we were referring to the crazy HIV origins theory that had just been touted -obviously we were not). Some of those comments we agreed with, others we did not. GARRY0000600 4. A take-home message from the call was that we should investigate further and write a scientific paper to clearly set-out the background on the topic and our findings. Indeed, one the of emailed agenda items for discussion after the call was: "Advice on whether KA, AR, RG and EH should publish this". Hence, we eventually wrote up our findings as a scientific (peer reviewed) paper. Critically, drafts of this paper were sent to all the people on the call, including those with the information that has been emailed to you. We have attached our first draft of what would eventually become our paper from Feb 7, which was circulated to everyone on the call. As you can see, it is essentially the basis of our final study and people on the call commented on it. 5. Very shortly after the call, the pangolin data came out. This was critical, and as Eddie wrote in an email to everyone on the call on Feb 9th: "Personally, with the pangolin virus possessing 6/6 key sites in the receptor binding domain, I am in favour of the natural evolution theory." With Andrew Rambaut replying: "I am of the view that the natural selection hypothesis is the most likely (specifically the non-bat reservoir). And as Eddie mentioned this is becoming more likely from day to day with the pangolin story." 6. Hence, it is completely and utterly false to claim that we (i) all thought it was a lab escape, (ii) that we were corrected ("schooled") in our views by the coronavirus experts on the call, and (iii) then submitted a Nature paper without anyone else knowing about it. The truth is that we had a range of views among us, our paper included the pangolin data that was not available at the time of the call, and we circulated drafts of our document to everyone. Importantly, our study was an evolutionary study based on genomic information, which is the only way to investigate the origins of SARS-CoV-2 we believe all the authors on our paper have a strong demonstrated record in answering exactly those types of questions for a multitude of viruses. 7. We also categorically deny that we were "spreading the rumor" that the virus was human engineered. As you can see from point 1 this did not come from us. Indeed, at the time, there were indeed rumours -which persists to this day -that SARS-CoV-2 was an engineered virus, but these certainly did not come from us. As you know, the White House OSTP asked for expert opinions on this question too (spurred by the HIV nonsense preprint), and Kristian was part of that panel (https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/lab-made-coronavirus-triggers-debate-34502). Our study directly addressed these rumors in a scientific way by considering that a lab escape could have occurred. We did not dismiss this possibility out of hand, but we scientifically investigated it. 8. We strongly reject the idea that we should not have raised nor discussed the possibility of lab escape: as scientists we have to present all the data and discuss it openly. That's what we did. To not have considered or mentioned the possibility of a lab escape would have been negligent. Is the person who emailed you seriously suggesting that we should not have discussed these issues? Wouldn't that be a cover-up? Indeed, the great irony is that 99.9% of the feedback we have received on our paper -including death threats -are people accusing us of dismissing the lab escape theory too quickly. Can you imagine if we had not mentioned -or considered -it all as suggested by some "coronavirus experts"? To is, this clearly appears to be a case of sour grapes based on half-truths that lack the full history, gossip, and likely stimulated by your recent (great) article with quotes from us on the questions you raised with Dr. Zhengli. It's telling that the person who emailed you is anonymous. We have absolutely no problem with people knowing that our views on this issue have evolved as more data have appeared -and continues to evolve to this day, should more data become available. That's GARRY0000601 science. And it's the only way to do it well. Indeed, we have told our history of thinking on this to many people: the way we set this up was a study of alternative hypotheses equally weighted priors, which we tested -our posterior clearly favors the hypothesis that this is a natural virus. As far as we can tell we are only 'guilty' of following the proper scientific method -but maybe we offended an ivory tower "coronavirus expert" in the process. It likely won't be the last time. Best, Eddie and Kristian PROFESSOR EDWARD C.

Fouchier" Subject: Re: Teleconference Date: 2 February 2020 at 7:30:12 pm AEDT To: Jeremy Farrar "rfgar Franci Goldin , "Kristian Dear Jeremy and others, This was a very useful teleconference. Given the evidence presented and the discussions around it, I would conclude that a follow-up discussion on the possible origin of 2019-nCoV would be of much interest. However, I doubt if it needs to be done on very short term, given the importance of other activities of the scientific community, WHO and other stakeholders at present. It is my opinion that a non-natural origin of 2019-nCoV is highly unlikely at present. Any conspiracy theory can be approached with factual information. I have written down some of the counter-arguments. It is a bit long (below) but wanted to share it with you anyway. GARRY0000603 Thanks for organizing this on such short notice, Kind regards Ron Ron's notes: An accusation that nCoV-2019 might have been engineered and released into the environment by humans (accidental or intentional) would need to be supported by strong data, beyond reasonable doubt. It is good that this possibility was discussed in detail with a team of experts. However, further debate about such accusations would unnecessarily distract top researchers from their active duties and do unnecessary harm to science in general and science in China in particular. At present, the arguments that nCoV-2019 could have emerged from an animal source is much stronger than other possibilities. Observations about the genome that were inferred to be suggestive for a non-animal origin: 1. HIV-like sequences in the spike protein. 2. Level of mutations in the spike protein region. 3. Presence of a furin cleavage site in the middle of spike 4. BamHl restriction site at the end of the spike sequence 5. An F-to-Y substitution in the receptor-binding domain of spike 6. Potential O-linked glycan sites protecting the cleavage site of spike 1. The biorxiv publication by Prashant Pradhan and colleagues from Delhi ("Uncanny similarity of unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV spike protein to HIV-1 gp120 and Gag") has already been heavily debated on biorxiv and virological.org. The similarity between the inserts in 2019-nCoV spike and sequences of HIV-1 is accidental. These are very short insert sequences that are highly similar to many Genbank entries. Such similarities are explained by pure chance alone. 2. Andrew Rambaut analyzed the level of mutations in the spike region of SARS-CoV with that of its closest bat virus relative and of 2019-nCoV and its closest bat virus relative. The level of mutations between the two pairs of viruses was in the same range. Thus, this level of mutations can arise under circumstances of natural emergence. 3. Bat coronaviruses generally do not have a furin cleavage site in the spike protein. Some human coronaviruses do have a furin cleavage site in spike, which must have evolved naturally. As animal reservoir and spill-over hosts are highly under-sampled, the presence of a furin cleavage site in spike in such species is unknown. When coronaviruses jump host barriers, this frequently involved adaptation of cleavage sites that may be targeted by various proteases. Given the presence of furin-like sites in human coronavirus and the mutation of protease cleavage sites upon coronavirus host-jumps in general, a natural origin of the furin site is certainly not impossible. 4. The BamHI restriction endonuclease site evolved due to a single (silent) nucleotide substitution as compared to the closest relative bat virus genome sequence. Restriction sites of 6 nucleotides can be found in every sequence, all over the genome, when 1 of the 6 positions is allowed to vary. We now find BamHI, next time it might be one of the plethora of other 6-nucleotide sequence motifs. This can be explained by pure chance. 5. The F-Y substitution in the spike receptor binding domain was observed in mouse-adapted SARS-CoV and in 2019-nCoV. It is generally absent in bat coronaviruses. This substitution is associated with host adaptation in mice. It may point to (natural) host adaption of 2019-nCoV (in mice, humans or unknown hosts) as well. It is possible that scientists would like to test the effect of F-Y because it was found in a mouse adaptation experiment. However, the logical way to test it would be in the original (SARS-CoV) virus backbone. There is no other reason to insert the F-Y substitution in an engineered virus. 6. It is unclear if the potential O-linked glycosylation sites 1) are used during glycosylation; 2) have a functional role for the spike protein; 3) were present in the ancestral virus from the original host. This is not an argument in the discussion on the origin of 2019-nCoV. Additional arguments: A. All focus is on spike. Spike is a highly variable protein in general, crucial for host adaptation and under strong natural selection. GARRY0000604 B. The virus backbone (beyond spike) is not an indicator of a human source of 2019-nCoV emergence. The virus itself has not been described or characterized previously and no reverse genetics system has been described for this virus. Any scientist wanting to investigate spike function (e.g. to study protease cleavage or the receptor-binding domain) would have used a well-characterized reverse genetics system that is already available (making accidental labescape unlikely). Anyone with malicious intend would have used a well-characterized virulent strain (SARS-CoV, MERSCoV) described and characterized (by others) in the literature. C. The patterns of mutations we observe in the receptor-binding domain and the protease cleavage sites of spike are typical for host-switched naturally evolving viruses. We can infer it for the naturally evolved human coronaviruses, we have seen it for the natural zoo noses of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Convergent (parallel) evolutionary events are common in virology. Also for influenza, we see the same mutations emerge during the pandemics of 1918 (HlNl), 1957 (H2N2) and 1968 (H3N2), in the 2013 zoonotic H7N9 virus and e.g. an epizootic in seals in 2014 (HlON7). Regardless of the divergent subtype, we see identical substitutions in the receptor-binding domains, identical substitutions in polymerase, and non-identical substitutions with identical phenotypic consequences (e.g. stability) in the genome. The fact that we (think we) see recognizable traits in spike does not mean it must be man-made. D. We do not know the source of 2019-nCoV. There is "~30 years of evolutionary gap" between 2019-nCoV and the closest bat virus relative. These 30 years may have been in any host. We have no idea what might have happened (in evolutionary sense) between BatCov/RaTG13 and 2019-nCoV. We should rest our case until we have a close relative of 2019-nCoV. Van: Jeremy FarrarDatum: zaterdag 1 februari 2020 om 21:59 Aan: "Fauci, Anthony (NIH/NIAID) [E]" • , Patrick Vallance sie Golding Onderwerp: Re: Teleconference Thank you to everyone for joining. There is clearly much to understand understand in this.

Jan 26. You call me (I was in Switzerland) to talk about some concerns coming out the US that the virus might be a lab escape. Patrick Vallance might have been on that call, I can't recall. You later forward me an email from Marc Lipsitch and others containing some comments from Richard Ebright.

Kristian contacts me to say that he has spotted some strange things in the issue -specifically the furin cleavage site and restriction sites -that we was concerned about. Given our conversation earlier that week, I called you and informed you of Kristian's findings. We then decided to have a broader discussion with key parties on this ASAP.

And as Eddie mentioned this is becoming more likely from day to day with the pangolin story." 6. Hence, it is completely and utterly false to claim that we (1) all thought it was a lab escape, (2) that we were corrected ("schooled") in our views by the coronavirus experts on the call, and (3) then submitted a Nature paper without anyone else knowing about it. The truth is that we had a range of views among us, our paper included the pangolin data that was not available at the time of the call, and we circulated drafts of our document to everyone. 7. We categorically deny that we were "spreading the rumor" that the virus was human engineered. At the time, there were indeed rumours -which persists to this day -that SARS-CoV-2 was an engineered virus, but these certainly did not come from us. As you know, the White House OSTP asked for expert opinions on this question too (spurred by the HIV REV0000712 nonsense preprint), and Kristian was part of that panel (https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/lab-madecoronavirus-triggers-debate-34502). Our study directly addressed these rumours in a scientific way by considering that a lab escape could have occurred. We did not dismiss this possibility out of hand, but we scientifically investigated it. We strongly reject the idea that we should not have raised nor discussed the possibility of lab escape: as scientists we have to present all the data and discuss it openly. That's what we did. To not have considered or mentioned the possibility of a lab escape would have been negligent. Is the person who emailed you seriously suggesting that we should not have discussed these issues? Wouldn't that be a cover-up? Indeed, the great irony is that 99.9% of the feedback we have received on our paper -including death threats -are people accusing us of dismissing the lab escape theory too quickly. Can you imagine if we had not mentioned -or considered -it all as suggested by some "coronavirus experts"? This clearly appears to be a case of sour grapes based on half-truths and likely stimulated by your recent (great) article with quotes from us on the questions you raised with Dr. Zhengli. It's telling that the person who emailed you is anonymous. We have absolutely no problem with people knowing that our views on this issue have evolved as more data have appeared -and continues to evolve to this day, should more data become available. That's science. And it's the only way to do it well. Indeed, we have told this to many people: the way we set this up was a study of alternative hypotheses equally weighted priors, which we tested -our posterior clearly favors the hypothesis that this is a natural virus. As far as we can tell we are only 'guilty' of following the proper scientific method -but maybe we offended an ivory tower "coronavirus expert" in the process. It likely won't be the last time. Best, Eddie and Kristian PROFESSOR EDWARD C.

On the call were two world-class virologists who actually work on coronaviruses, who set them straight in great detail. That seemed to be the end of the affair. But, incredibly, Andersen et al. turned around and submitted the Proximal paper to Nature with the exact opposite claim, i.e., that the virus was NOT human engineered. They used (without acknowledgment, of course) all the arguments provided by the coronavirologists on the initial call in which they had tried to raise the human-engineered alarm. I don't think it would be too hard to verify all this, if you feel like digging a little. If you're wondering if this could all possibly be true: ask yourself how this group of authors, none of whom work on coronaviruses, could have such detailed arguments about why SARS-CoV-2 was not human-engineered. The answer is that they couldn't (and didn't) -they were schooled by the coronavirus experts on the call. For the phone conference, Anthony Fauci called in Jeremy Farrar (Director of the Wellcome Trust). Farrar asked the coronavirus experts to join the call to listen to the claims. The call took place on a Saturday in early February (either the 1st or 8th, I'm not sure but I could probably find out). On the call making the claim were: Kristian G. Andersen, Andrew Rambaut, Edward C. Holmes, Robert F. Garry, but not Ian Lipkin. The coronavirus experts listened for a while and both quickly concluded that the reasoning was completely flawed, that the non-coronavirus virologists had no idea what they were talking about, and that the human-engineered claim was totally wrong. One of the coronavirus experts was entertaining guests that day and told the people on the conference call that they wanted to give their opinion and then go back to the guests. So they told them it was nonsense, gave them a list of reasons why, and got off the call. The other coronavirus expert stayed on the call, gave a similar opinion and the morning afterwards sent a detailed list of the reasons why the claim was certainly wrong. After the paper with the exact opposite claim was received at Nature, senior editor, Clare Thomas sent it out for review to some of the best people in the world ... Not surprisingly, this happened to include a very close colleague of one of the experts who had been on the conference call. You can perhaps imagine the shock. Thomas was quickly appraised of the situation and Nature rejected the paper. It was then sent to Nature Medicine, where it was soon published. One author on the paper was not on the conference call: Ian Lipkin. It's not clear how much of the back-story he is aware of. It might be worth giving him a call to ask, in case you feel like investigating. If his co-authors left him in the dark as to what actually happened and he's worried about the possible fallout he may want to help. I apologize for mailing you without revealing my name (at least for now). I work in the field and have heard this story from two people who were on the initial call with Fauci. I'm not keen to be personally involved, but I find the situation so outrageous, hypocritical, and shameless that I also find I can't keep silent. It doesn't change anything with respect to knowledgeable thinking about the origin of the virus, of course, but it's a pretty ugly situation that I (obviously) think should be exposed. -----EMAIL REPLY DRAFT----Hi Jon, Here are the facts: REV0000715 1. In early Feb we had spotted some features in the SARS-CoV-2 genome that at the time appeared unusual -particularly the furin cleavage site and the receptor binding domain. 2. At this stage we thought it was to wise ask for some other expert opinion on this, so a conference call was arranged. There were indeed some coronavirus experts on the call who we chose. 3. Clearly, some people on the call were very strongly of the opinion the possibility of a lab escape was ridiculous and listed reasons why it was unlikely (although there was also some initial confusion about whether we were referring to the crazy HIV origins theory that had just been touted -obviously we were not). Some of those comments we agreed with, others we didn't. There as a long email discussion about what the data said. A take-home message from the call was that we should go away and write something to clearly set-out the background science on the issue. 4. So, we eventually wrote up a paper. Critically, however, drafts of this paper were sent to all the people on the call, including those that have leaked out the information. I've attached here the draft of the document from Feb 7 that was circulated to everyone. As you can see, it is essentially the basis of the document and people on the call commented on it. 5. Very shortly after the call the pangolin data came out. This was critical. As I wrote in an email to everyone on the call on Feb 9th: "Personally, with the pangolin virus possessing 6/6 key sites in the receptor binding domain, I am in favour of the natural evolution theory." 6. Hence, it is completely and utterly false to claim that we all thought it was a lab escape, we were corrected in our views by the coronavirus experts on the call, and then submitted a Nature paper without anyone else knowing about it. The truth is that we had a range of views among us, our paper included the pangolin data that was not available at the time of the call, and we circulated drafts of our document to everyone. I also strongly reject the idea that we should not have raised nor discussed the possibility of lab escape: as scientists we have to present all the data and discuss it openly. That's all we did. To have not mentioned the possibility of lab escape would have been negligent. Is the person who emailed you seriously suggesting that we should have not discussed these issues? Wouldn't that be a coverup? Indeed, the great irony is that 99.9% of the feedback I've had on the paper -including death threats -are people accusing me of dismissing the lab escape theory too quickly!! Can you imagine if we had not mentioned it all? This is clearly just case of sour grapes based on some half-truths. It's telling that the person who emailed you is anonymous. I've absolutely no problem with people knowing that my views on this issue have evolved as more data have appeared. That's science. Indeed, I've told this to many people: the way see it is that we set-up an hypothesis and then tested it. As far I can tell we are only 'guilty' of following the proper scientific method. Hope this helps. Eddie REV0000716 <Summary.Feb7.pdf> REV0000717
