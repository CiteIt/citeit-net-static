Although my primary concern is that these experiments are done in Cat 3 labs. Kristian Andersen 11:14 Interesting. I'm all for GOF experiments. I think they're really important however performing these in BSL3 (or less) is just completely nuts! IMO it has to be performed at BSL-4 with extra precautions. I have evolved a bit on this point. I used to think they're really important, but I'm actually not so sure anymore. I thought it was really important that we understood whether e.g., avian influenza could be transmissible between humans¥ and importantly which steps (and how many)would need to be involved -but honestly I'm not sure that type of knowledge is at all actionable, while, of course being exceptionally dangerous. It only takes one mistake. Kristian Andersen 11:15 @Andrew Rambaut to this comment I think we should write a parallel document about scenarios for natural origins. The two things can be considered completely independently". Yup, totally agree. I'll take that whole section out of the document and write it all differently.Do you maybe want to take a stab on getting the other document started based on your points from the email? Andrew Rambaut 11:16 Yes my feeling is you have to consider the cost benefit for every experiment And do it safely. Kristian Andersen 11:47 February 2nd, 2020 Reading through Ron's comments again I agree on pretty much everything he's saying -I come to the same conclusions. Where we differ is that he's looking for very specific evidence proving that this is unnatural (which is understandable), but except for the most simple scenario where somebody plugged a gene into a preexisting backbone that would simply be impossible to prove. Natural selection and accidental release are both plausible scenarios explaining the data and a priori should be equally weighed as possible explanations:The presence of furin a posteriori proves me slightly more towards accidental release, but it's well above my paygrade to call the shots on a final conclusion. Andrew Rambaut 11:53 Given the shit show that would happen if anyone serious accused the Chinese of even accidental release my feeling is we should say that given there no evidence of a specifically engineered virus we cannot possibly distinguish between natural evolution and escape so we are content with ascribing  it to natural processes. Kristian Andersen 11:56 Yup.I totally agree that that's a very reasonable conclusion. Although I hate when politics is injected into science -but it's impossible not to, especially given the circumstances. We should be sensitive to that. (plus none of this matters at the moment) Separately - having all of these discussions is really critical to countering All the friggin' bullshit coming out and at the end of the day. that's probably the most important things that'll come out of this! The latest being two novel viruses circulating .. https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1.101/2020.01.30.926477v1 (I'm starting to think that for outbreak research the bioRxiv really needs to start screening submissions -it's a slippery slope but it's justified at this stage paper-2020-nature_medidne-proximal_origin bR bioRxiv Evolution and variation of 2019-novel coronavirus Background: The current outbreak caused by novel corornvirus (2019-nCoV) in China has become a worldwide concern. As of 28 January 2020, there were 4631 confirmed cases and 106 deaths, and 11 countries or regions were affected. Methods: We downloaded the genomes of 2019-nCoVs and similar isolates from the GlobalInitiative on Sharing Avian lnfluenza Database (GISAIO and nucleotide database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Lasergene 7.0 and MEGA 6.0 softwares were used to calculate genetic distances of the sequences. to construct phylogentic trees, and to align amino acid sequences. Bayesian coalescent phylogenetic analysis implemented in the BEAST software package was used to calculate the molecular clock related characteristics such as the nucleotide substitution rate and the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of 201 2019-nCoVs. Results: An isolate numbered EPI\_ISL \_ 403928 showed different phylogenetic trees and genetic distances of the whole length genome, the coding sequences (CDS}of ployprotein (P) spike protein ($), and nucleoprotein (N) from other 2019-nCoVs. There are22. 4, 2 variations in P, S, and N at the leveI of amino acid residues. The nucleotide substitution rates from high to low are 1.05x 10-2 (nucleotide substitutions/site/year. with 95% HPD interval being 6.27 x 10-4 to 2.72 x 10á2) for N. l.34 > 10á3(5.10 x 10-4, 128 x 10-2) for S, 1.69 x 10-3(3.94 x 10-4,3.60x 10á 3) for P. l.65 x 10á3 (4.47 x 10-4, 324., 10á3) for the whole genome respectively. At this nucleotide substitution rate, the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of 2019¥,~oVs appeared about 0.2S3¥0.59"1year b<:foret~ epidemic.
